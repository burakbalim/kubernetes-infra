## 🚀 Features

- Kubernetes cluster setup and configuration
- Deployment of common services and applications
- Automated management of infrastructure resources
- Monitoring and log collection tools
- Security configurations

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Kubernetes (v1.20+)
- kubectl 
- Terraform (optional, for IaC portions)
- Helm (optional, for application deployments)

## 🏗️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
